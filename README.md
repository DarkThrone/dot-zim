# Zimfw modules

This repo has some personal modules that I found useful and make MY workflow more productive. Doesn't mean they'll be useful to YOU. You are free to fork them and use them.

## gitgud

This module has a series of functions that use [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).

`gco`: This function allows you to switch branches using `fzf` previewing the last 10 commits.

`gadd`: This funciton allows you to add multiple files using `fzf`. You can select multiple files with `Shift` + `tab`.
